# Neovimrc

> I use Neovim, btw

This is my configuration for Neovim. This repository was a fork from kickstart.vim, but I've made a lot of changes since then.
A lot has been taken from ThePrimeagen's neovimrc because I am a bit dumb and I do not know lua.

It has pretty much everything that is present on Kickstart.nvim but a few things have been added and removed.

## Python Setup
With jupyter notebooks and a repl, works perfectly (at the moment). I can edit Jupyter Notebooks directly from neovim, works automatically and it does not create a separate file.

I can also execute the python code using `ipython` (the superior way to code Python) directly from the neovim terminal. It works for `.py` and `.ipynb` files.

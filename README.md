# Neovimrc

> I use Neovim, btw

This is my configuration for Neovim. This repository was a fork from kickstart.vim, but I've made a lot of changes since then.
A lot has been taken from ThePrimeagen's neovimrc because I am a bit dumb and I do not know lua.

It has pretty much everything that is present on Kickstart.nvim but a few things have been added and removed.
